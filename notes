TODOS:

    specific:

    set active in routine form; backend handle change
    better client side validation for routine form
    ensure routineSchedule exists on creation of routine; update of active
        -> new user creation, create default routines; exercises
    trim json payloads

    BLUR on all inputs
    Flash on success
    scrolly in forms
    transitions between states
    bug in edit routine form, exercise disappearing...?
    UI button press
    back buttons when PWA'd

    general:

    fix TODOS everywhere :)
    PWA stuff ~> workbox.js
    Loading spinner on initial load ~> SSR perhaps?
    exerciseHistory for tracking progress ~> d3.js
    unit tests??
    client side tests??
    dockerize for deployment
    chips + color for tagging types
