TODOS:

    specific:

    set active in routine form; backend handle change
    better client side validation for routine form
    ensure routineSchedule exists on creation of routine; update of active
        -> new user creation, create default routines; exercises
    trim json payloads

    general:

    fix TODOS everywhere :)
    PWA stuff ~> workbox.js
    Loading spinner on initial load ~> SSR perhaps?
    exerciseHistory for tracking progress ~> d3.js
    unit tests??
    client side tests??
    dockerize for deployment
