Front end:

    Vue
    Vue-router
    Vuex

    SASS with bootstrap extends for mobile responsiveness, mixins
        -> Dead simple UI; needs to run clean on mobile

    Unit testing as necessary for important features w/ Karma?

Backend:

    Laravel
        -> Best practices, unit testing, idioms

    MySQL
        -> Same old

    Dockerize for deploys
        -> No idea how to do this, learn!

Product considerations:

    I want to:
        Plan my lifts
        Track my lifts
        Automatically calculate new lifts based on success/fail with 5/3/1 or LP
        Be able to ad hoc my gym sessions by category (ie DB vs BB incline press), since machines aren't always open
        Create a repository of lifts to ad-hoc from
        Be able to access the above with a spotty connection; data conscious

    Misc:
        very lightweight UI as this is a web app on a phone
        mobile first UI given above
        see SL 5x5 UI for good example
        Squatting loading spinner; svg :)
        PWA for mobile optimization? -> WORKBOX!
        Maybe use sketch with bootstrap components to plan the UI + theme?


    A routine is a rotating series of exercises
    An exercise is a set of sets and reps for those sets
    

    NAV:
        "Active Routine" view 
            -> Current and upcoming gym sessions
            -> "Lift day" view; details for today's sets
        "Your Routines" view
            -> Create, read, update, delete routine
        "Your Lifts" view
            -> Create, read, update, delete lifts



TODOS:
    set active in routine form; backend handle change
    better client side validation for routine form
