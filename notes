Front end:

    Vue
    Vue-router
    Vuex

    SASS with bootstrap extends for mobile responsiveness, mixins
        -> Dead simple UI; needs to run clean on mobile

    Unit testing as necessary for important features w/ Karma?

Backend:

    Laravel
        -> Best practices, unit testing, idioms

    MySQL
        -> Same old

    Dockerize for deploys
        -> No idea how to do this, learn!

Product considerations:

    I want to:
        Plan my lifts
        Track my lifts
        Automatically calculate new lifts based on success/fail with 5/3/1 or LP
        Be able to ad hoc my gym sessions by category (ie DB vs BB incline press), since machines aren't always open
        Create a repository of lifts to ad-hoc from
        Be able to access the above with a spotty connection; data conscious

    Misc:
        very lightweight UI as this is a web app on a phone
        mobile first UI given above
        see SL 5x5 UI for good example
        Squatting loading spinner; svg :)
        PWA for mobile optimization? -> WORKBOX!
        Maybe use sketch with bootstrap components to plan the UI + theme?









TODOS:
    test protected api from /
    write unit test for checking auth
    write unit test for refresh token logic
